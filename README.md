# allergyalert

This project consists of two files : DatabaseCode.java.

The Food-Allert-Database.txt file is downloaded from the USDA food database: https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/docs/fndds-download-databases/

The DatabaseCode.java reads from the Database file and takes the user input in order to provide the user options of wanted items without their allergens.
